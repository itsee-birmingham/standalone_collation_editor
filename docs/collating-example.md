Currently there is one example available in the collation editor download, it is unfortunately in Greek and uses some Greek specific configurations rather than the default ones. To run this example start the collation editor following the [download and start up instructions](installation.html#download-and-start-up). Then visit:

```localhost:8080/collation```

In the text box type 'John.6.23' and hit run collation.

This should provide a collation of all Greek minuscule manuscripts of John 6:23.
